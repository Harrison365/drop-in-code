// You are building a student grade calculation system. Write a function called calculateOverallGrade that takes an array of student objects as input. Each student object contains properties like name and grades (an array). The function should calculate and return the overall grade (average) for each student, and store it as a new property called overallGrade in each object.

//e.g. [ { name: "Tom", grades: [10, 10, 10] },{ name: "Richard", grades: [10, 20, 30] },{ name: "Harry", grades: [20, 20, 0] }]

function addAverageGrade(arr) {}
console.log(
  addAverageGrade([
    { name: "Tom", grades: [10, 10, 10] },
    { name: "Richard", grades: [10, 20, 30] },
    { name: "Harry", grades: [20, 20, 0] },
  ])
);
